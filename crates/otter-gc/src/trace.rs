//! Type-tag → trace function dispatch table.
//!
//! Tracing is the hot path of every GC cycle. Phase-1 dispatch is a
//! single indexed load + indirect call: the [`TraceTable`] is a
//! `[Option<TraceFn>; 256]` keyed by [`crate::header::GcHeader::type_tag`]
//! — no `Box<dyn>`, no `dyn Any`, no downcast.
//!
//! # Contents
//!
//! - [`TraceFn`] / [`EphemeronTraceFn`] — function-pointer
//!   signatures stored in the table.
//! - [`SlotVisitor`] — visitor type alias the marker / scavenger
//!   pass to a `TraceFn`. Each call hands the visitor a `*mut
//!   RawGc` so the GC can update the slot in place when an object
//!   moves.
//! - [`TraceTable`] — the 256-entry dispatch array; `register::<T>`
//!   is the public entry point.
//!
//! # Invariants
//!
//! - Two registrations under the same `T::TYPE_TAG` must agree on
//!   the trace function. `register` enforces this with a
//!   `debug_assert`.
//! - A trace function may not allocate, may not run user JS, and
//!   may not enter the same heap recursively. Ordinary tracing
//!   must visit every strong [`crate::compressed::RawGc`] / `Gc<T>`
//!   slot. Ephemeron tracing must expose weak keys separately from
//!   conditionally-strong values.
//!
//! # See also
//!
//! - GC architecture plan §2.3 (TraceTable row), §6.1 (unsafe
//!   boundary).
