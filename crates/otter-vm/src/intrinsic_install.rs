//! Built-in installer trait and macro.
//!
//! Each JavaScript built-in class owns its full installation logic
//! inside its own module via the [`BuiltinIntrinsic`] trait. The
//! central [`crate::bootstrap`] table only orchestrates installation
//! order; it does not host any installer bodies. This keeps the
//! installer file small, makes the ownership of each surface obvious,
//! and lets a new built-in land by writing one per-class file plus
//! one entry in the bootstrap table.
//!
//! # Contents
//! - [`BuiltinIntrinsic`] — the trait every built-in installer
//!   implements.
//! - [`bootstrap_install_thunk`] — generic adapter turning
//!   `T::install` into a [`crate::bootstrap::BootstrapInstall`]
//!   function pointer through monomorphisation.
//! - [`bootstrap_entry!`] — declarative macro that produces a
//!   [`crate::bootstrap::BootstrapEntry`] for a given intrinsic type.
//!
//! # Invariants
//! - Implementations of [`BuiltinIntrinsic::install`] are responsible
//!   for the full surface of their class: constructor, prototype,
//!   prototype methods, static methods, constants, internal-slot
//!   defaults, prototype chaining. The installer must define the
//!   global binding so subsequent entries can resolve it.
//! - The thunk is `pub(crate)` so the macro can synthesize a
//!   `const`-eligible function pointer for the static
//!   [`crate::bootstrap::BOOTSTRAP_ENTRIES`] table.
//!
//! # Why a trait + macro
//! The `BootstrapInstall` function-pointer signature predates this
//! split. Closures with captures cannot live in a `static` array, so
//! the macro routes through a generic free function. Monomorphisation
//! gives each intrinsic type its own concrete `fn` pointer, preserving
//! the deterministic table layout while letting installer bodies live
//! anywhere in the crate.
//!
//! # See also
//! - [`crate::bootstrap`] — registry orchestration and telemetry.
//! - [`crate::string::intrinsic`] — first migrated user.
